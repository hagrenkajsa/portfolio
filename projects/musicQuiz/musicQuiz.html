        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>About the project</h3>
        <h4>Designing a music quiz feature for a music streaming app</h4>
        <p>
          As a project through out a course withe the focus on
          Design-Build-Test, me and my team of five students, designed a
          function for an mobile application in collaboration with a music
          streaming service in Sweden. The purpose of the function was to enable
          the users to create, host and join interactive music quizzes. <br />

          <br />
          The main challenge was to create a clear information flow and ensuring
          smooth, parallel interaction between the host and the participants. To
          overcome this, we focused on an iterative design approach and
          conducted extensive user testing. The project resulted in an
          interactive Figma prototype that was presented to the company and well
          received.

          <h3>The background to our idea</h3>
          <div class="category-block">
            <h4>A team of five who love to quiz together</h4>
            <p>
              The task was to find a company and develop a design-based solution
              for them, with a focus on the design–build–test process. Everyone
              on the team enjoys music quizzes, and it was something we often
              did together. This inspired the idea of designing a music quiz
              feature for a music streaming service. We then contacted a company
              within the music streaming industry, pitched our idea, and the
              project began.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>The final idea</h3>
          <div class="category-block">
            <h4>Interactive music quiz</h4>
            <p>
              The idea was to design a feature for their existing application
              that would enable users to create, host, and participate in music
              quizzes, either with their friends or with random people. Many
              online quizzes today only allow participants to answer the current
              question, but we wanted to make the quiz similar to a traditional
              music quiz with paper and pen, allowing participants to view the
              entire quiz and edit past questions.<br /><br />
              We want the quiz creator to have the ability to generate questions
              with AI based on the participants' music tastes. This feature can
              help the creator quickly craft a quiz that aligns with the
              participants' preferences.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Target group</h3>
          <div class="category-block">
            <p>
              The target group for this project included people aged 20 to 40
              with an interest in music quizzes.

        <div class="category-content">
          <h3>What do the users want?</h3>
          <div class="category-block">
            <h4>
              Collected user insights in the context of traditional music
              quizzes on paper
            </h4>
            <p>
              To begin the project, we conducted a quantitative study to explore
              the target group’s needs, preferences, and motivations in the
              context of music quizzes. To gather this data, we created a Google
              Form with questions divided into different categories.
              <br /><br />

              From prior research about music quizzes and from our own
              experience and assumptions, the target group has most experience
              with non-digital music quizzes, and therefore we formulated the
              form so that it did not reveal that our aim was to create a
              digital music quiz. Instead, we wanted to find user insights on
              traditional music quizzes in order to meet their needs and
              motivations in our design, solve their problems, and create
              something valuable for them with the help of technology.

          <h3>Design process</h3>
          <div class="category-block">
            <h4>We conducted multiple design and test iterations.</h4>
            <p>
              Our design process went through many iterations as we discovered
              new ideas while testing prototypes with users. The tests we
              conducted between design iterations mainly included A/B testing
              and Think-Aloud testing. While designing, we followed the
              company’s graphic design guidelines and rules, which was both
              interesting and enjoyable. This allowed us to focus more on
              optimizing the user flow rather than on making design component
              choices. <br /><br />
              One significant challenge was designing the UI while the game was
              ongoing. We had to create two interfaces for the same parts of the
              game: one view for the participants and another for the game host.
              When designing these two interfaces, it was crucial to consider
              how actions in one interface affected the other to ensure that the
              flow of events followed a logical order.
