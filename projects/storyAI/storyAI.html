        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>Task</h3>
        <h4>Develop an interactive mobile application</h4>
        <p>
          In a group project for a course called Prototype Development in Mobile
          Applications, we were tasked with creating an interactive mobile
          application using any technique of our choice while working with an
          agile approach.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Background</h3>
        <h4>Using generative AI to create personalized children’s stories</h4>
        <p>
          After talking to friends and family, we discovered a problem — parents
          spend a lot of money on children’s stories. A single book can cost
          between SEK70 and SEK130. That might not seem like much, but the
          stories are short and children grow quickly, so parents have to buy
          new books often. We also noticed that children are not always
          interested in the stories and can lose focus easily.<br /><br />

          When we started this project, generative AI was still quite new, so we
          wanted to explore if this could be part of the solutions.
          <br /><br />
        </p>
        <h3>Our idea</h3>
        <h4>
          A mobile application for generating personalized children’s stories
          with interactive moments
        </h4>
        <p>
          We came up with the idea after several brainstorming sessions and
          discussions. Our idea was to build an interactive application that
          lets users create customized stories for children with the help of
          generative AI. Our vision for the project was to give users quick and
          easy access to an exciting story that engages children at any moment,
          and we wanted to includ the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Automatically generate personalized children's stories based on
              user input with the help of generative AI
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Save favorite stories</p></li>
          <li><p>Adjust the content according to the child's age</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Add interactive moments during and/or after the story to support
              the child's language and cognitive development
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <h4></h4>
        <p>
          In this team project, we designed and implemented a mobile application
          with the functionality described above. The aim of the project was to
          focus on implementation rather than design, and we worked in sprints
          with an agile workflow. <br /><br />
          The main focus of this project was to develop our idea into a working
          mobile application, which is where we put most of our effort. We built
          the application using React Native and JavaScript for the front-end,
          used Firebase for data storage, Express.js to handle API requests, and
          Azure Web Apps to host our API. <br /><br />
          As the result of this project, we designed and implemented a mobile
          application that allows the user to automatically generate a
          personalized children’s story by entering the character’s name, story
          environment, and plot. To make the stories suitable for a wider range
          of ages, we also let the user enter the child’s age. Together with the
          other inputs, this information generates a personalized story.
          <br /><br />
          To generate the story, we used OpenAI’s API. The user’s input is sent
          together with a prepared prompt that asks the model to create a
          children’s story based on the given information. <br /><br />
          Each story includes three interactive moments and one final question.
          The story is divided into four parts: Introduction, Conflict, Climax,
          and Resolution. The interactive moments appear between these parts,
          where the user can choose how the story continues, so for example,
          “Should Lisa open the red door or the green door?”

            <p>
              The project was conducted through sprints with an agile workflow
              where we every other week presented our work and discussed
              problems, findings and solutions with other groups and their
              projects. <br /><br />
              Our team met twice a week to discuss, help each other, merge our

              We were four people in the group, and during the planning stage,
              we decided to work closely together since it was the first time
              for all of us developing a native mobile application. To keep the
              project organized, we divided the work into different areas of
              responsibility, with each person having one or two main areas to
              focus on. <br /><br />My areas of responsibility were front-end
              development and graphic design.

            <h4>React Native and JavaScript</h4>
            <p>
              After some research on frameworks and AI integration, we decided
              to build our application with the framework React Native using
              JavaScript, since it makes integration with other systems easier
              for this project.
            </p>

          <h3>Data Storage</h3>
          <div class="category-block">
            <h4>Firebase</h4>
            <p>
              We used Firebase to store our data because it provides a good way
              to handle real-time data updates, which we needed for the
              interactive parts where the story is updated with new content
              after each reader choice.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>Backend</h3>
          <h4>Express.js to handle API requests</h4>
          <p>
            We used Express.js to handle API requests and create a secure server
            environment. Express.js is simple, flexible, and fast, which made it
            a good fit for our project. It allowed us to build a POST API
            endpoint that works as a middle layer between our client app and
            OpenAI’s API. This setup helped us keep sensitive information, like
            API keys, safe on the server. We also used Firebase authentication
            to make sure only authorized users could access the API.
          </p>

          <h4>Azure Web App to host API</h4>
          <p>
            Our API was hosted with Azure Web App, which made it easy to deploy
            and manage in the cloud. Azure’s integration with GitHub allowed
            automatic updates every time we pushed new code, creating a smooth
            CI/CD workflow. This saved time and made it easier to focus on
            improving the application instead of handling manual deployments.

          <div class="category-block">
            <p>
              The result is an application where the user can easily and quickly
              create a personalized story by giving input such as the story’s
              character, environment, and plot. The user can also enter the
              child’s age to get a story that fits that age.
            </p>
            <p>
              To generate the story, we used OpenAI’s API. The user’s input is
              sent together with a prepared prompt that asks the model to create
              a children’s story based on the given information.

                  <strong>Random story (also called “quick story”):</strong>
                  generates a story immediately without any user input.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Normal story:</strong> a standard story that takes the
                  user’s instructions before generation.

                  <strong>Emotion detective:</strong> like a normal story, but
                  ends with a question about an emotion experienced during the

                  <strong>Vocabulary builder:</strong> a story meant to explore
                  difficult words. This category is not fully developed yet, so
                  it currently works like a normal story. The idea is to
                  highlight harder words and show a description when the user
                  taps a word, and include a question about a word at the end.
