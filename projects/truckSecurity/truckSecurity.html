        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>Project Background</h3>
        <h4>
          25% of all truck drivers have experienced theft at least once. 140
          thefts are reported every day, with an average daily loss of EUR
          800,000 in the EMEA region.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Most truck drivers have little to no support when it comes to
          preventing theft or receiving help during a theft. One way to reduce
          the risk is by using a security system. Currently, Volvo offers only
          limited security services to its customers and now the company wants
          to explore this area further.
        </p>
        <h3>Task</h3>
        <h4>
          Explore a security system that can prevent theft and support the
          driver during an ongoing theft.
        </h4>
        <p>
          The solution should be a concept of a holistic security system that
          supports truck drivers during criminal incidents, with a focus on
          security from the driver’s perspective and business from the
          customer’s perspective, which in Volvo’s case, primarily refers to
          fleet managers.
        </p>
        <h3>Research Questions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>RQ1:</strong> What are the security-related pain points
              from a driver’s perspective?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>RQ2:</strong> How can these pain points be addressed to
              both enhance driver security and prevent fuel and cargo theft with
              the help of a holistic security system?

            <p>
              The process is particularly effective for complex problems and is
              based on five key phases: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and
              Test

          <div class="category-block">
            <h4>The primary focus was on Empathize, Define and Ideate</h4>
            <p>
              The project aimed to explore the full design thinking process, but
              due to limited time, the primary focus was on the first three
              steps of the process. This decision was made because it is a
              relatively new research area that requires a deep understanding of
              the underlying problems and needs.

            <h3>Interview</h3>
            <h4>Interviews were conducted with eight truck drivers.</h4>
            <p>
              To gain in-depth insights into truck drivers’ security concerns,
              semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight truck
              drivers. The interviews were held via video calls, each lasting
              between 30–45 minutes. The primary purpose of the interviews was
              to gather a deep understanding of the problem area of theft in the
              truck industry.

            <h3>Interview participant</h3>
            <h4>A relatively diverse group of eight truck drivers.</h4>
            <p>
              I was unable to access any drivers directly through Volvo;
              therefore, I had to find participants myself. This was a
              challenge, but I managed to gather a group of eight drivers with
              diverse backgrounds and levels of experience. Considering the
              limited time and resources available for this project, the group
              can be regarded as a relatively representative sample of truck
              drivers.

            <h4>Semi-structured interviews through Teams meetings.</h4>
            <p>
              The participants had the option to be interviewed either in person
              or via Microsoft Teams. All of them chose to be interviewed online
              for various reasons. Each interview lasted approximately 30–40
              minutes and followed a semi-structured interview guide to ensure
              consistency while allowing flexibility in the discussions. Because
              security concerns are a complex topic, the semi-structured format
              made it possible to adapt questions as needed while still covering
              the most important themes. The interview guide contained 22 main
              questions, but I occasionally skipped or added questions depending
              on the participants’ responses. All interviews were recorded and
              transcribed using the built-in tools in Microsoft Teams.

              different categories related to driver security. To make the

              helps you structure qualitative data by assigning categories to
              the interview transcripts and organizing them in a hierarchical
              way.

                  Most respondents expressed frustration over crime in the
                  transport industry. Some said it disrupted the flow of work,
                  especially due to fuel theft. A few mentioned waking up to
                  find their fuel stolen, which caused delays in their schedule.

                perspective. The journeys were created using the online tool

                questions. During the workshop, we went through each JTBD
                statement one by one. Participants had five minutes to
                brainstorm solution ideas for the HMW questions, followed by a

              <p>
                The workshop generated several valuable ideas for improving
                truck driver security, particularly concerning fuel and cargo
                theft. To combine and refine these ideas into a holistic and
                feasible security system, I used the Theft Journey as a guiding
                framework, as it highlighted opportunities to both support the
                driver and deter the thief. For each opportunity identified in
                the journey, I matched relevant ideas from the workshop to see
                how they could contribute. This process helped me develop a
                comprehensive security system concept that simultaneously
                empowers the driver and prevents theft.

            <p>
              To create this system description, I had to have a close dialogue

              the frame of Volvo’s feasibility. <br />
              <br />
              The security system is built around two states: Proactive Action
              and Reactive Action. The purpose of the proactive action is to
              detect an incident. When an incident is detected, it triggers the
              reactive actions. The reason for this setup is to avoid having the
              full system active all the time, which helps reduce energy
              consumption. <br /><br />If you’re interested in learning more
              about the concept, please contact me and I’ll be happy to give you

            <h4>
              Six hypotheses were tested, where five of them were supported and
              one rejected.
            </h4>
            <p>
              Five hypotheses were tested through "Expert Stakeholder
              Interviews" and one through a "Partner and Supplier Interview".
              The testing process was exactly as the name suggests — interviews
              with either expert stakeholders or partners and/or suppliers,
              where we discussed each hypothesis and I received verbal
              confirmation on whether the hypothesis could be supported or not.
              <br /><br />
              A total of six tests were conducted on the hypotheses. Five of the
              hypotheses were supported to some extent, while one could not be
              fully supported. Table 11 provides an overview of the hypotheses.
              <br /><br />
              The decision regarding how many hypotheses to test and which type
              of test to conduct was made due to limited time.

              The research demonstrates that a holistic security system can

              In conclusion, this project explored the issue of cargo and fuel
              theft in the trucking industry and answered two research
              questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>RQ1:</strong> What are the security-related pain
                  points from a driver’s perspective?
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>RQ2:</strong> How can these pain points be addressed
                  to both enhance driver security and prevent fuel and cargo
                  theft with the help of a holistic security system?
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              To answer RQ1, the project found that truck drivers have clear
              security concerns. Some worry more about their personal safety,
              while others focus on protecting the truck and its cargo. However,
              most drivers expressed similar needs and wanted features such as
              cameras, alarm sounds, door sensors, evidence collection tools,
              and quick access to the police. <br /><br />
              The prototype developed in this project addresses RQ2. It provides
              a solution to the problems identified in RQ1 by focusing on a
              holistic security system designed to support the driver and stop
              thieves from completing a theft.<br /><br />
              To evaluate the concept from a business perspective, six
              hypotheses were tested. Five were supported, and one was not. The
              results indicate that the idea could represent a strong business
              opportunity because it appears both feasible to build and in
              demand on the market.<br /><br />
              The research also suggests that Volvo could offer this security
              system as an additional service. This would not only meet drivers’
              needs but could also reduce theft risk, lower insurance costs, and
              increase uptime which leads to higher profits for fleet managers.
              This was the main goal of the business idea.<br /><br />
              From Volvo’s perspective, there is a significant opportunity. The
              technology already exists, there is clear market demand, and
              people within Volvo Group’s finance and services departments
              believe that a system like this could become a valuable business
              opportunity.

              This research was conducted as a master’s thesis project that I
              worked on for 20 weeks, so there is much more to the project than
              what is presented here. If you’re interested in learning more or
