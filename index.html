              When concluding my studies, I completed my master’s thesis project
              in collaboration with Volvo Group within their Experience Design
              team. The focus of my research was to develop a tangible concept
              for a holistic security system that enhances security for truck
              drivers in relation to cargo and fuel theft on the road. The
              project followed the Design Thinking methodology in order to
              understand user needs and from that, design an add-on service that
              creates value for all stakeholders, including the driver, fleet
              owners and Volvo Group.

              As part of a school project in collaboration with a company called
              Daresay, my team and I designed and implemented a native mobile
              application for elderly home care. The purpose of the application
              is to facilitate documentation, communication and planning of
              shifts between the staff and management. One main function in the
              application is an AI feature that auto-generates a summary from
              the latest documentation about the elderly.

              Throughout a course project, my team and I designed and developed
              a mobile application that utilized AI to automatically generate
              children's stories with interactive moments. The story's content
              was based on user inputs, including character details,
              environments and plot preferences. A fun project where the biggest
              challenge was to implement and interact with OpenAI's API to
              optimize the story based on the user's preferences.

            <p>
              During my studies, I went on an exchange semester in South Korea,
              where I combined my major with exploring Korean food, culture and
              nature. I met many interesting people from around the world and
              learned a lot about their cultures, something I believe will be
              useful in my future work.

            <h3>UX & UI Design</h3>
            <p>
              One of my strongest skills and passions lies in UX design, where I
              find it fascinating to research user behavior, perception and
              problems and to explore how to meet their needs with solutions
              that are both aesthetic and functional. I strive to create
              experiences that go beyond expectations. I have a keen eye for
              shape, color, and content hierarchy, and I always keep the user’s
              perspective at the forefront of my design process. <br />
              <br />
              My greatest strength is my creativity. I love exploring new
              approaches to design, blending innovative ideas with established
              design principles and always a strong focus on accessibility.

            <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
            <p>
              In addition to UX design, I have a strong interest in front-end
              development. Most of my experience is in implementing mobile
              applications using React Native with JavaScript or TypeScript, as
              well as developing web applications with React. <br />
              <br />
              Through my education, I’ve also gained foundational knowledge in
              back-end development. While back-end isn't my primary focus, this
              background gives me valuable insight into what's possible when
              designing for users, providing a fuller perspective that I find
              beneficial when working on various projects.
